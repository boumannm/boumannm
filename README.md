# Hi 👋

I'm Michael.

I've been a tech enthusiast ever since i got my first computer somewhere around 1998. You know ... the early cable internet days where Pentium 3's reached 1GHz. Fast forward about a decade and i graduated as a System Administrator that specialises in Network Engineering. My eagerness to learn everything tech makes my knowledge span a wide array of topics like managing Windows and Linux Servers, writing SQL scripts, fixing and troubleshooting work and creating themes for a variety of platforms.

I am currently creating experiences for the Ghost CMS platform under the [SpookThemes](https://spookthemes.com) banner.
