# Hi 👋

I'm Michael. 

I create theme's for Ghost, WordPress and Hugo which i manage through [Canitia](https://github.com/Canitia). Check out the Ghost theme [Larua](https://github.com/Canitia/larua) and it's Hugo-based couterpart [Larua-Hugo](https://github.com/Canitia/larua-hugo) for example. 

Other things about me: 
- 🖥️ I enjoy all things tech.
- 📺 I love watching anime.
- 🎮 I love gaming.

**Canitia Xperiments**

New idea's and random theme fluff are managed from [Canitia Xperiments](https://github.com/CanitiaX). 

**The HowOnSwitch project**

As a tech-geek and a gamer i wanted to combine my latest gaming toy (the Nintendo Switch) and the technical side of games released on it. This led to my current project [HowOnSwitch](github.com/boumannm/switch). A project showing how games released on it run, what resolution, what FPS and other related specs.
